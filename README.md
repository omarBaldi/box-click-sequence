## Front-end interview challenge

---

The user will be presented with a N amount of boxes (where N is a positive integer greater than 0) rendered into the DOM.

The challenge consists in the following:

- as soon as the box is clicked, it should change the color to green

- after all of the boxes have been clicked (and therefore changed color), the boxes should revert back to their default color in the order they were clicked one by one.
